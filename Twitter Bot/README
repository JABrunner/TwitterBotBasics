With this program, there are a few basic scripts to run a bot to run some basic functions for Twitter.
These functions are as follows;

Following a certain user(s)

Updating the status for the user or "tweeting"

Updating the descritption of the user

Getting data from a specified user(s)

Liking or "Favoriting" a specified number of Tweets on the users time line

Liking or "Favoriting" a specified number of Tweet on specified users time line

This project was a bit of a challenge as some of the tutorials on line were incomplete or outdated due to either Twitter making changes to their API or differences in 
versions of Python. Eventually after enough research I managed to figure out any and all errors, while also fixing a security issue that hadn't been addressed in
any of the tutorials whatsoever.
